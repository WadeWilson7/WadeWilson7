# Hi, I'm PG 👋

Engineering student who builds things by understanding them.

I care about **fundamentals**, **systems thinking**, and **writing code that scales beyond toy problems**.

---

## 🔧 What I work with
- **Languages:** Python, JavaScript  
- **Core concepts:** Data structures, Neural Nets
- **Interests:** AI Agents, Machine Learning

---

## 🧠 Philosophy
- Depth > breadth  
- Code is a tool, not an identity  
- If I can’t explain it simply, I don’t understand it yet  

---

## 📂 What you’ll find here
- Small but **well-thought-out projects**
- Experiments that focus on **how things work under the hood**
- Code written to be **read**, not just executed

---

## 📈 Currently improving
- Writing safer and faster systems
- Reading other people’s code (the underrated skill)
- Turning ideas into maintainable software
